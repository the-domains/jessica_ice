# Jacobs University Foundation of America

In 2007, I embarked on a live changing journey to attend college at Jacobs University Bremen. Jacobs University is small private english speaking university in Northern Germany with students from over 92 nations. The education was truly world class and prepared me to be a global leader of tomorrow. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2a4f49a4-1130-471f-ad39-0772a8972604.jpg)

In an effort to give back to my alma mater, I have joined the board of the Jacobs University Foundation of America (JUFA) and serve as the Chair of the Development Committee to help develop a strategic direction for the organization. For more information about JUFA, [click here][0].
